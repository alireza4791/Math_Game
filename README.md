# Math_Game
 This is one of my favorite projects and definitely a highlight of my Front end coding skills, it was made using only HTML5,CSS3 and of course JAVASCRIPT with some of the ES6 functionalities like arrow functions. This game starts when we click the start button and once clicked the game will display two operands and an operator to the user. and below that we can see randomly generated numbers placed inside white squares but only one of them is the correct answer(the results are random numbers between 1 to 100 same for the operands). Furthermore we have a timer set to 60 seconds and a score section to see how many equations we have answered correctly. As expected once the timer runs out the game is over and the user will see a message telling them so and what their score is. Also worth mentioning there will be a success and failure message depending on the players choice when they click on the white boxes.
